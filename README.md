The parking lot is a “last-in, first-out” stack. When parking a new car, the program must first check to see if the car has the correct decal. If it does have the correct permit, the car may be added to the lot as long as there is enough room. To park a car, the car’s license tag is added to the parking lot stack. The parking lot can hold 20 cars at a time. If the parking lot is full, a waiting car can be added to a waiting queue. When a car leaves the lot, the next car in the queue will be able to park in the parking lot before allowing a new car to be entered. When a car owner retrieves a vehicle that wasn’t the last one in, the cars blocking it must temporarily move to the street so that the requested vehicle can leave.
